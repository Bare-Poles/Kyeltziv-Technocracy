kyeltziv_stachys,SHIP,"This lightweight, high-speed interceptor drone is designed to overwhelm hostile fighters with its sheer volume of missile and particle discharger fire. This intense barrage can also prove effective against frigates and even larger ships, provided they lack robust point-defense systems.",,,
kyeltziv_cirsium,SHIP,"An advanced Kyeltziv escort interceptor drone, equipped with paired burst rifles and a pack of shock missiles, can easily neutralize even the toughest strikecraft.",,,
kyeltziv_ophrys,SHIP,"An atypical interception craft, its heavy chassis provides the survivability needed to endure enemy fire while efficiently dispatching other strikecraft with its diverse arsenal. The craft's core has been meticulously tuned to optimize point-defense targeting performance, making the Ophrys a formidable threat to strikecraft and missiles alike.",,,
kyeltziv_asteryx,SHIP,"The fighter is equipped with a shock weapon capable of overwhelming shield emitters. Its powerful engines make it a highly responsive escort, able to quickly adjust to new targets and proving difficult to dislodge once engaged.",,,
kyeltziv_ilex,SHIP,The Ilex is an assault fighter more than capable of dealing heavy damage to unshielded targets. Its paired chaff dispensing systems significantly increase its survivability against hostile point defense fire.,,,
kyeltziv_prinos,SHIP,"The Prinos is an export variant of the Asteryx, and as such, it lacks some of the advanced systems featured in the original. While the change to an IR Pulse laser from the more advanced Kyeltziv weaponry might seem like a direct downgrade, it can be advantageous in certain situations.",,,
kyeltziv_vahlia,SHIP,"A specialized assault corvette designed to latch onto targets and wear down their defenses, leaving them vulnerable to be finished off by other vessels. Power from the craft's core has been diverted to enable limited self-repair capabilities and enhanced targeting of enemy weapon systems.",,,
kyeltziv_helianthus,SHIP,"While lacking the raw damage of a more conventional bomber, the Helianthus compensates with three key advantages: guided munitions, a high quantity of munitions per strike, and a consistent damage profile against both shields and armor.",,,
kyeltziv_cynara,SHIP,"Featuring a paired strike package of both Shock cannon fire and Halke missiles, the Cynara is capable of delivering a highly effective strike on any target. The craft's core has been fine-tuned to enhance weapon performance against both shields and armor.",,,
kyeltziv_pereskia,SHIP,"An unusual craft, the Pereskia is designed with a singular purpose: distracting hostile point defenses. It excels in its intended role, but practical utilization of the openings it creates can be tricky.",,,
kyeltziv_solanum,SHIP,"The close support firepower provided by the Solanum makes it a valuable choice for frontline carriers. The installed galvanic mortar boasts remarkable range for a weapon mounted on a fighter, allowing it to frequently outrange ship-mounted weaponry.",,,
kyeltziv_wolffia,SHIP,"While only a single Wolffia is manufactured from an LPC, the craft features a limited internal microforge of its own, enabling it to deploy a swarm of Kiusa Drones capable of effortlessly tearing through inbound missiles. The craft's core has been finely tuned to enhance the performance of the mounted Stutter Beam.",,,
kyeltziv_salvage_drone,SHIP,"The Kyeltziv derivative of the Mining Pod features improved armament and an added control relay adjunct, allowing it to operate at a short distance from its mothership. However, its combat capabilities remain relatively unimpressive, making it more valuable for its utility in salvage operations.",,,
kyeltziv_laite,SHIP,"The Laite is a robust station defense drone specializing in point defense. Since it requires no crew, travel drive, or any form of independent command core, the Laite significantly exceeds its weight class in combat.",,,
kyeltziv_sokea,SHIP,"The Sokea, an autonomous AI fighter, boasts tremendous agility. Its impressive speed and substantial shield emitter leave little room for weaponry, allowing only a miniature ion weapon to be mounted.",,,
,,,,,
kyeltziv_vassily,SHIP,"The Vassily is a contentious vessel; with its extremely limited weapon mounting options, it typically has to make sacrifices to fulfill any one specific role. However, the vessel's low logistical burden makes deploying multiple ships, each specialized to support one another, a practical option.",,,
kyeltziv_ilya,SHIP,"The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya, is a solid all-rounder with a decent array of weapon mounts, enabling it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower. Combined with a variable loader system, it serves as a robust core for smaller Kyeltziv fleets.",,,
kyeltziv_dobrynya,SHIP,"The Dobrynya is a lightweight Drone Tender equipped with a single support drone, rather than a full-scale autoforge capable of supporting modular LPCs. This setup allows even the smallest fleets to gain light carrier-like support, though it remains undeniably inferior to dedicated carrier craft.",,,
kyeltziv_ruslan,SHIP,"The Ruslan marks the first venture by Kyeltziv engineers into creating a vessel capable of carrying the Shock-Driver weapon system. It serves effectively as a long-range kinetic fire support vessel. However, with limited options outside of its main gun, it struggles against lightweight or agile targets.

The G-Series frigate hull was chosen for the initial Shock-Driver development due to its relatively low cost compared to larger hulls. Although the frigate-grade flux core hampers sustained fire from the Shock-Driver, the Ruslan has proven the worth of the weapon system. This effort laid the foundation for developing larger vessels equipped with more capable flux cores to be armed with Shock-Drivers.",,,
kyeltziv_ilya_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have been made more flexible as a trade-off.

The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya, is a solid all-rounder with a decent spread of weapon mounts, enabling it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower. This export model features a simplified mono booster system, which is less potent than the normal variable booster.",,,
kyeltziv_peikko,SHIP,"A rare example of Kyeltziv Technocracy phase technology, the Peikko proves to be a highly mobile flanking and strike vessel. The integrated Shock Mitrailleuse, initially considered an experimental placeholder weapon, demonstrated remarkable effectiveness during practical trials, leading to its standard installation.

Departing from standard Kyeltziv hull naming practices, the P-Series of vessels are not limited to one hull size or core design skeleton. Instead, the P-Series represents an all-encompassing classification for all designs of Phase Vessels that utilize the Kyeltziv style of phase coil.",,,
kyeltziv_lycaenid,SHIP,"As a departure from conventional Kyeltziv ship design, the Lycaenid features an all-energy mount loadout, making it an ideal point defense platform. Although its drones are lightly armed, they typically serve as the vessel's primary anti-ship capability.

The shield on this ship is also different from the standard shielding employed on most Kyeltziv vessels. It offers far greater coverage and efficiency than typical Kyeltziv shielding, making the Lycaenid a respectable frontline asset capable of drawing fire away from more vulnerable allies.",,,
kyeltziv_ilya_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya, is a solid all-rounder. It features a decent array of weapon mounts, enabling it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower.",,,
kyeltziv_ruslan_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The Ruslan is the first venture by Kyeltziv engineers into producing a vessel equipped with the Shock-Driver weapon system. It demonstrates effectiveness as a long-range kinetic fire support vessel, but this Symmetrist modification lacks any secondary weapon options outside of the primary armaments.

Exchanging a single full-size Shock-Driver for a pair of lighter Short-Spool variants reduces single-shot damage capability. However, the ability to project a more consistent volley of fire proves highly effective.",,,
kyeltziv_peikko_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

A rare example of Kyeltziv Technocracy phase technology, the Peikko is a highly mobile flanking and strike vessel. This Symmetrist variant is equipped with a unique Fusion Mitrailleuse, which proves highly effective against armor, especially when combined with the exceptional mobility the Peikko can offer.

Departing from standard Kyeltziv hull naming practices, the P-Series of vessels is not limited to one hull size or core design skeleton. Instead, it serves as an all-encompassing classification for all designs of Phase Vessels that use the Kyeltziv style of phase coil.",,,
kyeltziv_paimen,SHIP,"The Paimen is a lightweight logistical support vessel capable of deploying the same swarm of Kiusa drones as those fielded by the Wolffia Support Corvette. While some consider it a competitor to the Shepherd, the Paimen emphasizes combat and storage capacity at the expense of not supporting hardware suited for survey or salvage duties-a tradeoff deemed worthwhile by many.

The pack of Salpa drones it carries can surprisingly perform dual roles as cargo tugs. By using a remote control interface, their combat-rated engines, along with a simple hot-swap of the PD Rifle for a standard docking clamp, allow them to shift cargo containers with ease.",,,
kyeltziv_otkryt_ex,SHIP,"The Kyeltziv hull, modified for export, has had its advanced rangefinders and other systems replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have been made more flexible in exchange.

The Otkryt was designed to revolutionize Kyeltziv frigate doctrine by featuring a single, heavier main weapon instead of a spread of lighter ones. However, sustained field trials revealed no significant practical advantage over existing hulls. To recoup the development costs, rather than scrapping the design outright, a decision was made to hastily convert the ship into an export model.",,,
kyeltziv_vassily_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Vassily has several extra engines installed, significantly increasing its speed at the expense of firepower.

During the course of the refit, the pirates removed the drone bay. However, in a rare moment of clarity, they realized the ship needed some anti-missile protection beyond sheer speed, so they installed a light defensive gun on a rear-facing mount. This token defensive measure has proven sufficient to satisfy most captains.",,,
kyeltziv_ruslan_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull, stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates, this modified Ruslan has had its main gun ""improved"" and additional thruster ports mounted across the hull.

While it may not be the most practical or effective weapon, the appeal of having a giant shotgun bolted to the side of the ship is readily apparent to pirate crews. Consequently, this ship enjoys great popularity among those fortunate enough to acquire one, earning it a reputation far exceeding what its actual combat performance would suggest.",,,
,,,,,
kyeltziv_perun,SHIP,"The Perun is the first destroyer manufactured by the Kyeltziv Technocracy and serves as the foundation for all their O-Series destroyer hulls. Primarily designed as a versatile base that could be expanded to develop more specialized hulls, the Perun is notable for its significant amount of ""unused"" hull space, which is often employed as storage for additional missiles and cargo.",,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog,SHIP,"The Dazhbog is the primary combat destroyer utilized in Kyeltziv fleets. While it boasts a moderately respectable armament, it is enhanced by the advanced Variable Booster System and complemented by a wing of escort fighters. This combination enables it to effectively contend with destroyers of comparable tonnage.",,,
kyeltziv_yinglong,SHIP,"The Yinglong, a light carrier, offers smaller Kyeltziv fleets the capability to deploy strikecraft. In stark contrast to the conventional Drover carrier, which emphasizes the mass deployment of strikecraft, the Yinglong can service only a single wing of craft. However, it typically deploys higher quality strikecraft, supported by an integrated cluster of Loinen Drones.",,,
kyeltziv_znatok,SHIP,"As can be clearly seen, the Znatok is based on the Yinglong and has been heavily modified to function as a command and control hub for salvage operations while still remaining a somewhat combat-viable vessel. The redesign also added respectable cargo and fuel storage capacity to the hull. Although initially designed for ease of loading and storing salvaged materials, it is fully capable of carrying any type of cargo required.",,,
kyeltziv_tarsus,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistic vessel, enhancing its self-defense capabilities but making it more costly to recover after being deployed in combat.

A Tarsus freighter refitted to Kyeltziv specifications exchanges ballistic mounts for energy mounts and sacrifices one of its turret mounts for a missile hardpoint.

It retains all the core features that make the Tarsus-class so well-known, but gains a small boost in offensive power to hopefully deter frigate assaults long enough to escape from the battlefield.",,,
kyeltziv_valkyrie,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistic vessel, enhancing its self-defense capabilities. However, these modifications have also increased the cost of recovery after combat deployment.

In this modified variant of the Valkyrie, the weapon mount types have been changed, and one side of the nose has been completely reworked to include a missile hardpoint.

The alteration to the flare system, which now uses Siren-Pattern flares, along with the installation of a second set of launch ports, has proven highly effective against incoming missiles. Nonetheless, the loss of one of the point defense turrets leaves the ship somewhat more vulnerable to fighter attacks.",,,
kyeltziv_phaeton,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistics vessel, enhancing its self-defense capabilities but increasing its recovery cost after combat deployment.

Originally a Phaeton tanker, most of its ballistic mounts have been converted to energy weapons. However, one ballistic mount remains, now positioned on a raised platform, providing 360-degree coverage.

The raised turret allows the ship to engage hostiles from any direction. Additionally, the flare tubes now release bursts of guided chaff. Although these chaff bursts have shorter lifespans than conventional flares, they compensate with limited guidance capabilities.",,,
kyeltziv_perun_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have been made more flexible in exchange.

The Perun is the first destroyer manufactured by the Kyeltziv Technocracy and served as the foundation for all of their O-Series destroyer hulls. Primarily designed as a base that could be expanded upon to develop more specialized hulls, the Perun is notable for having a large amount of ""unused"" hull space, typically utilized for additional missile and cargo storage.",,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have been made more flexible in exchange.

The Dazhbog is the mainline combat destroyer employed in Kyeltziv fleets. While it only has a moderately respectable armament, this export model features notably flexible mounts, allowing for a wide range of potential loadouts.",,,
kyeltziv_xiezhi,SHIP,"The Xiezhi is a direct descendant of the Ruslan, equipped with the same weapons package but featuring a destroyer-grade flux core, enabling it to support sustained fire. The addition of a secondary small turret alongside the main gun provides the option to install a weapon to support the Shock-Driver or to mount something for close-in defense.",,,
kyeltziv_xinzang,SHIP,"Mounting the Mauste XLRM as its primary weapon, the Xinzang excels in delivering long-range suppressive firepower. While it effectively suppresses targets at extreme distances, it lacks the raw damage output of the more common Kyeltziv siege-class vessels.",,,
kyeltziv_kiilto,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law and deemed an abomination by the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least, that is how the official histories tell it.

The Kiilto is nearly unique among Remnant vessels, being the result of a joint venture between the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Kyeltziv Technologies. While designed to provide long-range firepower, the Kiilto AI has been known to close in on targets to bring its full weapon load to bear on a single target.",,,
kyeltziv_katsoja,SHIP,"The highly advanced Kyeltziv phase vessel can deploy a spread of shock mines before diving in to deliver a powerful burst of damage with its weapons. Unlike most phase vessels, it is also moderately capable of acting as a supporting escort. However, the poor sustained performance typical of phase craft makes this role not always the most practical.

The mine strike system employed by this vessel is notably inferior to the one seen on the Doom-class Cruiser, as it deals less heavy damage to ships. Nonetheless, the sheer number of mines it can deploy means that they can still be a significant threat if used effectively.",,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The Dazhbog is the mainline combat destroyer employed in Kyeltziv fleets. This Symmetrist modification grants it significantly enhanced direct fire capability and equips it with a wing of powerful interceptor drones, further boosting its firepower.",,,
kyeltziv_zlatko,SHIP,"The destroyer, known as the Zlatko, employs a pair of armed drones to supplement its relatively light fixed frontal firepower. The Zlatko is capable of delivering a massed barrage that can overwhelm enemy defenses through sheer volume of fire. Unlike most Kyeltziv vessels, it features energy mounts capable of engaging targets in its frontal arc.",,,
kyeltziv_yinglong_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, its advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have been made more flexible as a trade-off.

The Yinglong, a light carrier, offers smaller Kyeltziv fleets the capability to field strikecraft. In contrast to the more standard Drover carrier, which favors massed deployment of strikecraft, this export variant of the Yinglong can only service a single wing of craft. Nevertheless, it can field higher-quality craft that are supported by its integrated cluster of Rail Drones.",,,
kyeltziv_xinzang_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export has seen its advanced rangefinders and other high-tech systems replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have been made more flexible.

This export model of the Xinzang sacrifices both the Mauste XLRM and its drone system to support a pair of missile mounts and a fast loading system. While this means it is less capable of providing extreme-range support, it gains significant tactical flexibility. Additionally, even with the primary targeting array for the Mauste XLRM stripped of its more advanced components, it no longer needs to provide accurate long-range tracking for the Mauste XLRMs. This allows it to sufficiently improve the tracking performance of any installed missiles.",,,
kyeltziv_paistaa,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation, the Paistaa exists in defiance of both Domain and Hegemony law and is considered an abomination by the Church of Galactic Redemption. The First AI War purportedly saw these creations purged from the Sector, or so the official histories claim.

The Paistaa stands nearly unique among Remnant vessels as the outcome of a joint venture between the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Kyeltziv Technologies. At its core, the hull is structured around a teleporter system that enables it to deploy drone platforms anywhere in its vicinity. While it may not appear as immediately threatening as the more common mine-teleporting systems, its capacity for suppression and distraction makes it a formidable adversary.",,,
kyeltziv_prochnyi,SHIP,"Little more than a platform for deploying Linnake Gun Platforms, the Prochnyi is a heavily modified O-Series destroyer that dedicates a significant portion of its mass to an autoforge and requisite support systems necessary for the deployment of Gun Platforms. Although it performs poorly in direct engagements, it can become a significant force multiplier if allowed to remain behind the front lines, where it can deploy its platforms for fire support duties.",,,
kyeltziv_perun_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Perun is filled to the brim with missiles, offering a swift demise, either to its crew or its target.

A prime example of pirate ingenuity, this ship excels at one thing and does it (reasonably) well: charging in and unleashing a barrage of missiles and cannon fire. The installation of a Canister Flak array serves a dual purpose. More conservative captains use it as a defensive measure, while the more reckless see it as another weapon to unleash point-blank on their hapless targets.",,,
kyeltziv_zlatko_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Zlatko now features a large cannon grafted to its front, among other questionably sane alterations.

The drone bay has been hacked and coerced into accepting standard LPCs. While this modification doesn't make the ship as effective as a proper carrier, having a wing of fighters on call significantly enhances its power when raiding commerce fleets.",,,
kyeltziv_khoronit,SHIP,"The Khoronit is a testament to the pinnacle of Kyeltziv Technologies' capabilities, capable of engaging vessels several times its size with ease.

Despite its impressive power, the internal classification of ""Expedition Vehicle"" and various unusual system configurations suggest that this vessel was not designed for warfare, but rather for some unknown esoteric purpose.

Part numbering and mismatched wear markings, along with various other indications, suggest that this class of vessel has undergone serial production. However, only one has been confirmed active in the Persean sector-much to the relief of many admirals.",,,
,,,,,
kyeltziv_podenka,SHIP,"A solid general-use light cruiser, the Podenka might be somewhat lightly armed for a vessel of its class, but it boasts a remarkably small logistical burden due to its highly efficient design. Its superior mobility can also be an unpleasant surprise for unprepared captains, as it can even outrun some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,
kyeltziv_bystro,SHIP,"A carrier conversion of the H-Series Cruiser hull, the Bystro exemplifies Kyeltziv carrier doctrine in action, designed for the deployment of a smaller number of high-quality strikecraft wings. Additionally, the Bystro boasts sufficient ballistic and missile weaponry to pose a significant threat to any hostile vessels that attempt to close in and engage it in direct combat.",,,
kyeltziv_strekoza,SHIP,"Heavier than most Kyeltziv cruisers, the Strekoza is capable of inflicting significant damage on any target. With its overall solid performance, the Strekoza can operate as a frontline combat vessel while also delivering a formidable burst of strike damage with its paired missile mounts.",,,
kyeltziv_pyralid,SHIP,"Highly specialized, the role of the Pyralid in combat is dictated by the integrated Volley-Fire Shock-Driver, which provides it with impressive long-range kinetic firepower. While additional weaponry can be mounted outside of the integrated system, these are typically employed either to support the main gun or for close-range defense.",,,
kyeltziv_podenka_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

A solid general-use light cruiser, this Symmetrist modification of the Podenka features an array of lighter guns complemented by substantial missile mounts, enabling it to deliver an impressive barrage of firepower for its logistical maintenance cost. The superior mobility of the craft can also catch unprepared captains off guard, as it is capable of outpacing some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,
kyeltziv_podenka_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and drone systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives. However, the weapon mounts have gained greater flexibility in the process.

As a solid general-use light cruiser, the Podenka may be somewhat lightly armed for its class, but it benefits from a very small logistical burden due to its highly efficient design. The craft's superior mobility can catch unprepared captains off guard, as it can even outrun some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,
,,,,,
kyeltziv_ilkut,SHIP,"The standard capital-grade vessel of the Kyeltziv fleets, the Ilkut, can be considered a ""Jack of all trades."" While the design may lack dedicated focus and specialization in any one area, it boasts respectable flexibility in its tactical capabilities depending on its outfitting. Despite this adaptability, it can't be denied that the Ilkut has somewhat limited armament for a battlecruiser. Generally, it must ensure all of its myriad systems complement each other to compare favorably to other vessels of similar tonnage.",,,
kyeltziv_narva,SHIP,"A Capital-grade carrier, the Narva was designed to deploy Kyeltizv's recently developed ""Corvette"" grade LPCs. This allowed the vessel to easily field more advanced and costly strike craft than most carriers typically can. However, the comparatively limited number of decks means that any gain in strike craft quality is offset by a reduction in quantity.",,,
,,,,,
kyeltziv_station_1,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv Technocracy-designed orbital station features a pair of combat modules and modest axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies, allowing the projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,
kyeltziv_station_2,SHIP,"A large Kyeltziv Technocracy-designed battlestation is augmented with support modules, a pair of combat modules, and modest axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and substantial stockpiles of weapons and supplies, enabling the projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,
kyeltziv_station_3,SHIP,"An enormous Kyeltziv Technocracy-designed star fortress stands as the pinnacle of Kyeltziv defensive engineering. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies, allowing for the projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,

kyeltziv_light_galv_hwz,WEAPON,"An advanced long-range bombardment weapon system, the ""shells"" fired are essentially containment enclosures for energized plasma.

Galvanic weapons may have sub-par projectile velocity, but they compensate with projectiles that remain coherent and stable over very impressive distances.",Close Support,,
kyeltziv_galv_hwz,WEAPON,"An advanced long-range bombardment weapon system fires heavy ""shells,"" which are essentially containment enclosures for energized plasma.

Galvanic weapons may have sub-par projectile velocity but compensate by boasting projectiles that remain coherent and stable over impressively long distances.",Close Support,,
kyeltziv_galv_bombard,WEAPON,"An advanced extreme-range bombardment weapon system fires massive ""shells"" that are essentially containment enclosures for energized plasma.

While galvanic weapons have sub-par projectile velocity, they compensate by maintaining projectile coherence and stability over remarkably impressive distances.",Close Support,,
kyeltziv_shock_culverin,WEAPON,"A light cannon with a non-standard payload, primarily effective against shields but also possessing a minor disruptive effect.

The miniature shock cores loaded in the shells fired by this weapon further increase its pressure on targets, as they can catalyze and arc to nearby components, dealing minor damage.",Anti Shield,,
kyeltziv_shock_culverin_twin,WEAPON,"Twin light cannons loaded with a non-standard payload are primarily effective against shielding, but they also have a minor disruptive effect.

The miniature shock-cores loaded in the shells this weapon fires enable it to put additional pressure on targets by catalyzing and arcing to nearby components, dealing minor damage.

Essentially a pair of Shock Culverins mounted onto a heavier frame, the recoil forces of opposing barrels impact accuracy somewhat. However, this drawback is more than compensated for with the doubled rate of fire.",Anti Shield,,
kyeltziv_shock_palliser,WEAPON,"Heavy cannon with a non-standard payload, primarily effective against shielding and featuring a disruptive effect.

The shells are packed with a cluster of light shock-cores. Although a single larger core would have provided superior disruptive capability, it would also have required a far greater flux draw to charge before firing.",Anti Shield,,
kyeltziv_buster,WEAPON,"It fires bursts of semi-stable fusion reactions, which are devastating against lighter vessels. However, the sheer volume of fire allows it to wear down even heavy armor over time.",Anti Armor,,
kyeltziv_buster_twin,WEAPON,"The Fusion Buster, when mounted with a heavier assembly, becomes highly effective against armored targets due to its sheer volume of fire.",Anti Armor,,
kyeltziv_light_killCloud,WEAPON,"When fired, a Light Killcloud Projector saturates the approach vector with a barrage of microprojectiles, proving devastating against both fighters and missiles.",Point Defence,,
kyeltziv_heavy_killCloud,WEAPON,"A Heavy Killcloud Projector deploys a cluster of proximity-fused microwarheads, granting it unprecedented area saturation capability.",Point Defence,,
kyeltziv_packet,WEAPON,"The specialized cyclic feed of this weapon allows it to deliver shots at a blistering rate of fire. However, the linked autoloader is unable to maintain this pace, resulting in a notably reduced fire rate over the long term.

The volatile plasma packets enclosed in this weapon's shells are specially designed to shear off chunks of armor plating upon penetrating detonation. This additional energy is directed outward from the impact point, making it of no additional value against hull or shielding.",,,
kyeltziv_packetRib,WEAPON,"The heaviest volatile plasma packet weapon that Kyeltziv engineers have successfully produced. While the fire rate is somewhat limited due to safety concerns, the heavy shells can nonetheless prove highly effective at shredding armor.

The volatile plasma rounds fired by this weapon push the boundaries of what is considered safe for storage. If they were any appreciable amount larger, there would be a risk of the sheer concentration of volatile plasma auto-igniting from even the most minor unexpected agitation.",,,
kyeltziv_shock_fougasse,WEAPON,"A short-range disruption weapon that fires a spread of disruption-tuned shock cores, highly valued for its ability to rapidly disable exposed targets.

Similar in principle to the Shock Springald, this weapon delivers an impressive level of disruption. While it may not be as capable of piercing shielding, it more than compensates with the sheer volume of projectiles it can output.",Fires a wide spread of charged shock-cores,,
kyeltziv_springald,WEAPON,"A derivative of Kyeltziv shock weaponry that focuses on disruption rather than damage, this weapon may lack the instantaneous disruptive potential of ion weaponry, but its ability to pierce shields should not be underestimated.",,,
kyeltziv_lorentz,WEAPON,"An otherwise outdated conventional naval cannon, modified to include a secondary electromagnetic acceleration stage. While it is highly flux-efficient, its performance is sub-par against both shields and armor.",,,
kyeltziv_lorentzTwin,WEAPON,"A pair of Lorentz rifles mounted together. The heavier configuration allows for slightly extended barrels and a more extensive heatsink array, resulting in improved range and flux efficiency.",,,
kyeltziv_fusionHoufnice,WEAPON,"The long-range fusion warhead cannon features decently high shot power and relatively low flux overhead, allowing it to serve as an effective sustained anti-armor threat.

This relatively recent development adheres to the design brief of enhancing the ability of Kyeltziv vessels to better combat armored targets at a distance.

The munitions loaded in this weapon contain a cluster of smaller, semi-stable fusion rounds, similar to those used in the more common series of Fusion Buster weapons. These rounds have detonators timed to concentrate destructive potential on a single point, granting the weapon impressive effectiveness against armor. However, the inherent instability of the warheads leads to somewhat inconsistent performance compared to more conventional munitions.",,,
kyeltziv_compact_shock_driver,WEAPON,"A compact version of the Shock-Driver, typically found in Kyeltziv vessels, fires rounds that are generally less effective than those used in integrated models. However, they still offer considerable disruptive power.

Following the successful demonstration of the integrated Shock-Drivers' value, this modular variant was developed to enable a more flexible application of the system.",,,
kyeltziv_cranequin,WEAPON,"Unique among shock weapons, this one triggers the Shock Core upon firing, resulting in projectiles with tremendous kinetic energy but devoid of the disruptive effects typically associated with shock weaponry.",,,

kyeltziv,FACTION,"Born from Kyeltziv Technologies, a megacorporation specializing in light drone craft and semi-exotic weapons systems, the Kyeltziv Technocracy emerged in the Persean sector after the fall of the gate system left one of its branches stranded.

Initially, the Kyeltziv Technocracy constructed outposts on numerous promising worlds with the intent of starting colonization. However, all of these outposts were either abandoned or destroyed during the first AI war, leading the Technocracy to adopt a more inward-focused approach.
