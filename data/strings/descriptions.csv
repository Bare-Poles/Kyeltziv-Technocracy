kyeltziv_stachys,SHIP,A lightweight high speed interceptor drone that is designed to overwhelm hostile fighters with sheer volume of missile and particle discharger fire. This same volume of fire can prove effective against frigates and even heavier ships if they lack effective point defense coverage.,,,,,
kyeltziv_cirsium,SHIP,"An advanced Kyeltziv escort interceptor drone, a combination of paired burst rifles and a pack of shock missiles allows it to make short work of even the toughest strikecraft.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ophrys,SHIP,"An atypical Interception craft, its heavy chassis gives it the survivability to take fire from other strikecraft while dispatching them with its broad selection of weaponry. The craft's core has been tuned to optimise point defense targeting performance, making the Ophrys a serious threat to any and all strikecraft and missiles.",,,,,
kyeltziv_asteryx,SHIP,This fighter mounts a shock weapon making it able to overwhelm shield emitters. The crafts powerful engines make it a highly responsive escort that can rapidly adjust to a new target and prove difficult to dislodge once it has engaged with them.,,,,,
kyeltziv_ilex,SHIP,The Ilex is an assault fighter that is more than capable of dealing heavy damage to unshielded targets. Paired chaff dispensing systems significantly increase survivability in the face of hostile point defense fire.,,,,,
kyeltziv_prinos,SHIP,"The Prinos is an export variant of the Asteryx, and as such lacks some of the advanced systems featured by the original. While the change to an IR Pulse laser from the more advanced Kyeltziv weaponry might seem like a direct downgrade, it can prove advantageous in some situations.",,,,,
kyeltziv_vahlia,SHIP,"A specialised assault corvette intended to stick to a target and wear down their defenses, leaving them open to be finished off by other vessels. Power from the the craft's core has been diverted to allow for limited self repair capabilities and improved targeting of enemy weapons systems.",,,,,
kyeltziv_helianthus,SHIP,"While lacking the raw damage of a more conventional bomber, the Helianthus makes up for it with three things: guided munitions, quantity of munitions in each strike and a consistent damage profile against both shields and armour.",,,,,
kyeltziv_cynara,SHIP,"Featuring a paired strike package of both Shock cannon fire and Halke missiles, the Cynara is able to deliver an effective strike on any target. The craft's core has been tuned to improve weapons performance against both shielding and armour.",,,,,
kyeltziv_pereskia,SHIP,"An unusual craft, the Pereskia is of a singular purpose, distracting hostile point defenses. It proves more than capable of its intended role, but it can be tricky to make practical usage of the openings that it produces.",,,,,
kyeltziv_solanum,SHIP,"The close support firepower provided by the Solanum makes it a valuable choice for frontline carriers. The installed galvanic mortar has remarkable range for a weapon mounted on a fighter, allowing it to outrange ship-mounted weaponry quite regularly.",,,,,
kyeltziv_wolffia,SHIP,"While only a single Wolffia is manufactured from an LPC, the craft features a limited internal microforge of its own, allowing it to deploy a swarm of Kiusa Drones that are able to tear through inbound missiles with ease. The craft's core has been tuned to improve the performance of the mounted Stutter Beam.",,,,,
kyeltziv_salvage_drone,SHIP,"Kyeltziv derivative of the Mining Pod, armament is improved and an added control relay adjunct allows it to operate a short distance from its mothership. Still remains rather unimpressive in combat capability and of more value for their utility in salvage operations.",,,,,
kyeltziv_laite,SHIP,"The Laite is a heavy station defense drone focused on point defense. Because it requires no crew, travel drive, or any kind of independent command core, the Laite can punch well above its weight class in combat.",,,,,
kyeltziv_sokea,SHIP,"An autonomous AI fighter, the Sokea is tremendously agile. The sheer speed and respectable shield emitter leave little room for weapons mounting, allowing only a miniature ion weapon to be installed.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_vassily,SHIP,"The Vassily is a contentious vessel, with its extremely limited weapon mounting options it typically has to make sacrifices in order to fulfil any one specific role. But the vessels low logistical burden makes deploying multiple ships, each specialised to support each other a practical option.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ilya,SHIP,"The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya is a solid all-rounder with a decent spread of weapon mounts allowing it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower, combined with a variable loader system it is a solid core for smaller Kyeltziv fleets.",,,,,
kyeltziv_dobrynya,SHIP,"A lightweight Drone Tender, the Dobrynya is outfitted with a single support drone rather than a full blown autoforge that can support modular LPCs. It allows even the smallest fleets to gain light carrier-like support, but is undeniably inferior to dedicated carrier craft.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ruslan,SHIP,"The Ruslan is the first foray by Kyeltziv engineers into producing a vessel to carry the Shock-Driver weapon system. It proves an effective long range kinetic fire support vessel, but with extremely limited options outside of the main gun it can suffer when facing lightweight or agile targets.

The G-Series frigate hull was picked for initial Shock-Driver development as it is relatively cheap compared to other larger hulls, despite the frigate-grade flux core hampering sustained fire from the Shock-Driver the Ruslan proved the worth of the weapon system and laid the foundations for larger vessels with more capable flux cores to be armed with Shock-Drivers.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ilya_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya is a solid all-rounder with a decent spread of weapon mounts allowing it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower, this export model has a simplified mono booster system, that is less potent than the normal variable booster.",,,,,
kyeltziv_peikko,SHIP,"A rare example of Kyeltziv Technocracy phase technology the Peikko proves a highly mobile flanking and strike vessel. The integrated Shock Mitrailleuse installed on this vessel was initially merely an experimental placeholder weapon, but the results in practical trials lead to it becoming installed as standard.

A departure from standard Kyeltziv hull naming practices, the P-Series of vessels are not limited to one hull size or core design skeleton, but instead is an all encompassing classification for all designs of Phase Vessel that use the Kyeltziv style of phase coil.",,,,,
kyeltziv_lycaenid,SHIP,"As a departure from conventional Kyeltziv ship design the Lycaenid features an all-energy mount loadout making it an ideal point defense platform, its drones although rather lightly armed are typically the only real anti ship capability for the vessel.

The shield on this ship is also different from the standard shielding employed on most Kyeltziv vessels, with far greater coverage and even greater efficiency than typical Kyeltziv shielding. This makes the ship respectably capable at acting as a frontline asset to draw some fire away from other more vulnerable allies.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ilya_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The standard Kyeltziv frigate hull, the Ilya is a solid all-rounder with a decent spread of weapon mounts allowing it to deliver a respectable amount of firepower.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ruslan_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The Ruslan is the first foray by Kyeltziv engineers into producing a vessel to carry the Shock-Driver weapon system. It proves an effective long range kinetic fire support vessel, but this Symmetrist modification lacks any weapon options outside of the primary weapons.

Exchanging a single full size Shock-Driver for a pair of lighter Short-Spool variants reduces the single-shot damage capability, but the capability to project a more consistent volley of fire proves highly effective.",,,,,
kyeltziv_peikko_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

A rare example of Kyeltziv Technocracy phase technology the Peikko proves a highly mobile flanking and strike vessel. This Symmetrist variant mounts a unique Fusion Mitrailleuse which proves highly effective against armour especially when combined with the sheer mobility the Peikko can offer.

A departure from standard Kyeltziv hull naming practices, the P-Series of vessels are not limited to one hull size or core design skeleton, but instead is an all encompassing classification for all designs of Phase Vessel that use the Kyeltziv style of phase coil.",,,,,
kyeltziv_paimen,SHIP,"The Paimen is a lightweight logistical support vessel that is able to deploy a the same swarm of Kiusa drones as fielded by the Wolffia Support Corvette. Considered a competitor to the Shepherd by some, the Paimen focuses more on combat and storage capacity in exchange for not supporting hardware suited for survey or salvage duties, something considered a worthy tradeoff by some.

The pack of Salpa drones carried by the craft can surpisingly pull double duty as cargo tugs, as with the use of a remote control interface, their combat rated engines and a simple hot-swap of the PD Rifle for a standard docking clamp allows them to shift cargo containers with ease.",,,,,
kyeltziv_otkryt_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

The Otkryt was designed as to revolutionise Kyeltziv frigate doctrine, with a single heavier main weapon rather than a spread of lighter ones. After sustained field trials showing no real practical advantage over existing hulls, an attempt to recoup the development costs of the ship was made and it was hastily converted into an export model rather than scrapping the design outright.",,,,,
kyeltziv_vassily_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull that has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Vassily has had several extra engines installed, significantly increasing speed but at a sacrifice of firepower.

In the course of the refit pirates removed the drone bay, but in a rare moment of clarity realised that the ship will need some anti-missile protection beyond sheer speed and installed a light defensive gun on a rear facing mount. This proves more than enough to satisfy most captains, despite being little more than a token defensive offering.",,,,,
kyeltziv_ruslan_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull that has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Ruslan has had the main gun ""improved"" and various additional thruster ports mounted across the hull.

While not necessarily the most practical or effective weapon, the appeal of having a giant shotgun bolted to the side of your ship is readily apparent to pirate crews, and as such this ship sees great popularity among those able to acquire one, giving it a reputation far exceeding that which its actual combat performance would suggest.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_perun,SHIP,"The Perun is the first destroyer manufactured by the Kyeltziv Technocracy and proved the base for all of their O-Series destroyer hulls. Primarily designed as a base that could be expanded upon to develop more specialised hulls, the Perun is notable for having a large amount of ""unused"" hull space that is typically used as storage for additional missiles and cargo.",,,,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog,SHIP,"The Dazhbog is the mainline combat destroyer employed in Kyeltziv fleets, while it only has a moderately respectable armament it is combined with the advanced Variable Booster System and a wing of escort fighters, which in combination allows it to hold its own against destroyers of comparable tonnage.",,,,,
kyeltziv_yinglong,SHIP,"A light carrier, the Yinglong provides an option to allow even smaller Kyeltziv fleets to field strikecraft. A complete opposite in design concept to the more standard Drover carrier which favours massed deployment of strikecraft, the Yinglong is only able to service a single wing of craft, but will typically field higher quality craft which are backed up by its integrated cluster of Loinen Drones.",,,,,
kyeltziv_znatok,SHIP,"As can be clearly seen, the Znatok is based on the Yinglong and has been heavily modified in order to function as a command and control hub for salvage operations while still remaining a somewhat combat viable vessel. The redesign also saw a respectable cargo and fuel storage capacity added to the hull, which while designed for ease of loading and storing salvaged materials is fully capable of carrying any sort of cargo required.",,,,,
kyeltziv_tarsus,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistic vessel that grants it greater self-defense capabilities, but makes it more costly to recover from being deployed in combat.

A Tarsus freighter refit to Kyeltziv specifications, exchanges ballistic mounts for energy, and sacrifices one of its turret mounts for a missile hardpoint.

Retains all of the core features that make the Tarsus-class so well known, but gains a small punch to hopefully deter frigate assaults for long enough to escape from the field of battle.",,,,,
kyeltziv_valkyrie,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistic vessel that grants it greater self-defense capabilities, but makes it more costly to recover from being deployed in combat.

Modified variant of the Valkyrie, weapon mount typing has been changed, and one side of the nose has seen a complete rework to mount a missile hardpoint.

The alteration to the flare system to use Siren-Pattern flares, as well as the installation of a second set of launch ports proves highly effective against inbound missiles, but the loss of one of the point defense turrets renders the ship somewhat more vulnerable to fighter attack.",,,,,
kyeltziv_phaeton,SHIP,"Kyeltziv engineers have applied a series of unconventional modifications to this logistic vessel that grants it greater self-defense capabilities, but makes it more costly to recover from being deployed in combat.

A remodeled Phaeton tanker, most of the ballistic mounts are converted to energy, but one remains as ballistic but is mounted on a raised platform giving it full 360 coverage.

The raised turret gives this ship the ability to fire on hostiles no matter what direction they approach from, and the flare tubes now fire bursts of guided chaff which while shorter lived than conventional flares makes up for it by having limited guidance.",,,,,
kyeltziv_perun_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

The Perun is the first destroyer manufactured by the Kyeltziv Technocracy and proved the base for all of their O-Series destroyer hulls. Primarily designed as a base that could be expanded upon to develop more specialised hulls, the Perun is notable for having a large amount of ""unused"" hull space that is typically used as storage for additional missiles and cargo.",,,,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

The Dazhbog is the mainline combat destroyer employed in Kyeltziv fleets, while it only has a moderately respectable armament this export model has decently flexible mounts allowing for a wide range of potential loadouts to be considered.",,,,,
kyeltziv_xiezhi,SHIP,"The Xiezhi is a direct descendant of the Ruslan, mounting the same weapons package but with a destroyer grade flux core that gives it the capability to support sustained fire. The addition of a secondary small turret alongside the main gun allows for a choice of installing a weapon to support the Shock-Driver, or to mount something for close-in defense.",,,,,
kyeltziv_xinzang,SHIP,Mounting the Mauste XLRM as its primary weapon the Xinzang is able to provide long ranged suppressive firepower. While readily able to suppress targets at extreme range it lacks the raw damage output of the more common Kyeltziv siege class vessels.,,,,,
kyeltziv_kiilto,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Kiilto is near unique among Remnant vessels, being the result of a joint venture between the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Kyeltziv Technologies. While designed around providing long range firepower The Kiilto AI has been known to close in so it can bring its full weapon load to bear on a single target.",,,,,
kyeltziv_katsoja,SHIP,"A highly advanced Kyeltziv phase vessel, able to deploy a spread of Shock mines before diving in to deliver a heavy burst of damage with its weapons. Unlike most phase vessels is also moderately capable of acting as a supporting escort, but the poor sustained performance typical of phase craft makes this not always the most practical tasking.

The mine strike system employed by this vessel is notably inferior to the one seen on the Doom class Cruiser as they are less able to deal heavy damage to ships, but the sheer number of the mines it can deploy means that they can none the less be a major threat if used well.",,,,,
kyeltziv_dazhbog_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

The Dazhbog is the mainline combat destroyer employed in Kyeltziv fleets, this Symmetrist modification grants it far greater direct fire capability and a wing of powerful interceptor drones to further enhance its firepower.",,,,,
kyeltziv_zlatko,SHIP,"A destroyer that employs a pair of armed drones to supplement its relatively light fixed frontal firepower. The Zlatko is able to deliver a massed barrage of firepower that can overwhelm enemy defenses through sheer weight of fire, and unlike most Kyeltziv vessels features energy mounts that are able to engage targets in its frontal arc.",,,,,
kyeltziv_yinglong_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

A light carrier, the Yinglong provides an option to allow even smaller Kyeltziv fleets to field strikecraft. A complete opposite in design concept to the more standard Drover carrier which favours massed deployment of strikecraft, this export variant of the Yinglong is only able to service a single wing of craft, but can field higher quality craft which are backed up by its integrated cluster of Rail Drones.",,,,,
kyeltziv_xinzang_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and other systems have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

This export model of the Xinzang sacrifices both the Mauste XLRM and it's drone system in order to support a pair of missile mounts and a fast loader system, while this means it is less capable at providing extreme range support it gains in tactical flexibility. Also of note is that even with the primary targeting array for the Mauste XLRM being stripped of its more advanced components, it no longer needing to provide accurate long range tracking solutions to the Mauste XLRMs means that it can prove sufficient to notably improve the tracking performance of any installed missiles.",,,,,
kyeltziv_paistaa,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Paistaa is near unique among Remnant vessels, being the result of a joint venture between the Tri-Tachyon Corporation and Kyeltziv Technologies. The core of the hull is built around a teleporter system that allows it to deliver drone platforms to anywhere in its vicinity, while less immediately threatening than the more common mine teleporting systems, it can pose a significant threat in sheer suppression and distraction potential.",,,,,
kyeltziv_prochnyi,SHIP,"Little more than a platform for deploying Linnake Gun Platforms, the Prochnyi is a heavily modified O-Series destroyer that dedicates a significant portion of its mass to fielding an autoforge and requisite support systems for the deployment of Gun Platforms. While it fares poorly when forced into direct engagements it can prove a significant force multiplier if allowed to sit behind the front lines and deploy its platforms for fire support duties.",,,,,
kyeltziv_perun_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull that has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Perun has been filled to the brim with missiles and offers a swift death, either to its crew or its target.

A prime example of pirate design sense, this is a ship that can do one thing and do it (reasonably) well. Charge in and unload a barrage of missiles and cannon fire. The installation of a Canister Flak array serves two purposes: More conservative captains will see it as a means of defense, while those more reckless will see it as another weapon to unload point-blank into their hapless targets.",,,,,
kyeltziv_zlatko_p,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull that has been stolen and haphazardly repurposed by pirates. This modified Zlatko has had a large cannon grafted to its front among other questionably sane alterations.

The drone bay has been hacked and cajoled into accepting standard LPCs, and while this doesn't make the ship anywhere near as effective as a proper carrier, having a wing of fighters on call proves a great force multiplier when raiding commerce fleets.",,,,,
kyeltziv_khoronit,SHIP,"The Khoronit is a demonstration of the peak of Kyeltziv Technologies capabilities, able to engage vessels several times its size with ease.

Despite its impressive power, the internal classification of ""Expedition Vehicle"" and various unusual systems configurations suggest that this vessel was not designed for warfare, and was instead built for some unknown esoteric purpose.

Part numbering and mismatched wear markings alongside various other tells suggest that this class of vessel has undergone serial production, but only one has been confirmed active in the Persean sector, much to the relief of many admirals.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_podenka,SHIP,"A solid general use light cruiser, the Podenka may be somewhat lightly armed for a cruiser but has a very small logistical burden for one thanks to its highly efficient design. The superior mobility the craft possesses can also be an unpleasant surprise to unprepared captains, as it can even outrun some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,,,
kyeltziv_bystro,SHIP,"A carrier conversion of the H-Series Cruiser hull, the Bystro is a prime example of Kyeltziv carrier doctrine in action, designed for the deployment of a smaller number of high-quality strikecraft wings. The Bystro also possesses sufficient ballistic and missile weaponry to pose a threat on its own to any hostile vessels that attempt to close in and engage it in direct combat.",,,,,
kyeltziv_strekoza,SHIP,"Heavy at least as far as Kyeltziv cruisers go, the Strekoza is capable of dealing significant damage to anything it targets. Overall featuring solid performance, the Strezoka is able to operate as battleline combat vessel that can also provide a not inconsiderable burst of strike damage with its paired missile mounts.",,,,,
kyeltziv_pyralid,SHIP,"Highly specialised, the role of the Pyralid in combat is dictated by the integrated Volley-Fire Shock-Driver which gives it impressive long ranged kinetic firepower. While mounting additional weaponry outside of the integrated system, they are typically employed to either support the main gun or for close range defense.",,,,,
kyeltziv_podenka_sym,SHIP,"This vessel has been heavily modified and reworked by the Kyeltziv Technocracy Symmetrist Bureau.

A solid general use light cruiser, this Symmetrist modification of the Podenka features a spread of lighter guns backed up by rather heavy missile mounts, allowing it to deliver a rather heavy barrage of firepower for the logistical cost of maintaining the vessel. The superior mobility the craft possesses can also be an unpleasant surprise to unprepared captains, as it can even outrun some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,,,
kyeltziv_podenka_ex,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv hull modified for export, the advanced rangefinders and drone system have been removed and replaced with simpler alternatives, but the weapon mounts have also been made more flexible in exchange.

A solid general use light cruiser, the Podenka may be somewhat lightly armed for a cruiser but has a very small logistical burden for one thanks to its highly efficient design. The superior mobility the craft possesses can also be an unpleasant surprise to unprepared captains, as it can even outrun some of the slower destroyers in the sector.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_ilkut,SHIP,"The standard capital grade vessel of Kyeltziv fleets, the Ilkut can be considered a ""Jack of all trades"" as while the design may lack dedicated focus and specialisation in any one area, it has respectable flexibility in its tactical capabilities depending on how it is outfitted. Despite the flexibility in how it can be outfitted, it can't be denied that the Ilkut has somewhat limited armament for a battlecruiser and generally has to focus all of its myriad systems to complement each other in order to compare to other vessels of comparable tonnage.",,,,,
kyeltziv_narva,SHIP,"A Capital grade carrier, the Narva was designed to field Kyeltizvs recently developed ""Corvette"" grade LPCs, this lead to the vessel being able to easily field more costly strikecraft than most carriers are typically able to but the comparatively limited number of decks means that any gain in strikecraft quality is offset by a loss in quantity.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_station_1,SHIP,"A Kyeltziv Technocracy designed orbital station featuring a pair of combat modules and modest axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies allowing projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_2,SHIP,"A large Kyeltziv Technocracy designed battlestation augmented with support modules in addition to a pair of combat modules and modest axial rotation. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies allowing projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_3,SHIP,"An enormous Kyeltziv Technocracy designed star fortress, the pinnacle of Kyeltziv defensive engineering. This platform hosts shipyards, habitats, factories, and large stockpiles of weapons and supplies allowing projection of military and industrial power throughout the local orbital volume.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_station_module_main,SHIP,"A very heavy station defense module, this component alone demonstrates firepower comparable to a standard line battleship alongside a relatively small fighter bay. The combined mounting station segment - including this and counterweight defense and armor modules - is generally operated at a modest rate of rotation to permit a reasonably  balanced on-target/recovery cycle.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_module_main_3,SHIP,"A very heavy station defense module, this component alone demonstrates firepower comparable to a standard line battleship alongside a relatively small fighter bay. The combined mounting station segment - including this and counterweight defense and armor modules - is generally operated at a modest rate of rotation to permit a reasonably  balanced on-target/recovery cycle.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_module_end,SHIP,"A support bastion may be mounted on larger battlestations and star fortresses to enhance defense. This unit is designed to support other, direct firepower-focused modules by maintaining pressure through exploiting missile strike opportunities and providing additional fighter support. A respectable point defense array discourages strike fighters while heavy armor allows for uninterrupted operation under heavy bombardment. ",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_module_end_3,SHIP,"A support bastion may be mounted on larger battlestations and star fortresses to enhance defense. This unit is designed to support other, direct firepower-focused modules by maintaining pressure through exploiting missile strike opportunities and providing additional fighter support. A respectable point defense array discourages strike fighters while heavy armor allows for uninterrupted operation under heavy bombardment. ",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_station_blocker,SHIP,"An armored spar used to protect the flank of a station's primary batteries, this defense element is constructed of modular nanoforged components mounted on a tough yet relatively flexible structural lattice. Station armor is designed to find an ideal compromise between hardness, deflection, impact absorption, and heat dispersion across a wide range of combat scenarios, and as a rule permits for more generous mass allowance than could be reasonably mounted on a starship.

This Kyeltziv variant of armoured spar also features a couple of  light defensive weapons, granting it some minor active defensive capability.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_armour_small,SHIP,"Heavy battlestation armor is assembled in various forms from modular pieces to fit site-specific requirements. The primary structure, pierced only under conditions of heavy bombardment, consists of a custom semi-flexible high-tensile lattice filled with ultrahard nanoforged ceramic-metal composite blocks. Over this are placed alternating layers of foamed metal and 'wrap' consisting of many layers of sacrificial/reflective ablation skin.

This unit demonstrates the classic chevron arrangement.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_armour_large,SHIP,"Heavy battlestation armor is assembled in various forms from modular pieces to fit site-specific requirements. The primary structure, pierced only under conditions of heavy bombardment, consists of a custom semi-flexible high-tensile lattice filled with ultrahard nanoforged ceramic-metal composite blocks. Over this are placed alternating layers of foamed metal and 'wrap' consisting of many layers of sacrificial/reflective ablation skin.

This unit is an enlarged chevron arrangement.",,,,,
kyeltziv_station_armour_large2,SHIP,"Heavy battlestation armor is assembled in various forms from modular pieces to fit site-specific requirements. The primary structure, pierced only under conditions of heavy bombardment, consists of a custom semi-flexible high-tensile lattice filled with ultrahard nanoforged ceramic-metal composite blocks.

This unit is an enlarged asymmetric chevron arrangement.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
kyeltziv_light_galv_hwz,WEAPON,"An advanced long-range bombardment weapon system, the ""shells"" fired are little more than containment enclosures for energised plasma.

Galvanic weapons have sub-par projectile velocity, but make up for it by having projectiles that remain coherent and stable out to very impressive ranges.",Close Support,,,,
kyeltziv_galv_hwz,WEAPON,"An advanced long-range bombardment weapon system, fires heavy ""shells"" that are little more than containment enclosures for energised plasma.

Galvanic weapons have sub-par projectile velocity, but make up for it by having projectiles that remain coherent and stable out to very impressive ranges.",Close Support,,,,
kyeltziv_galv_bombard,WEAPON,"An advanced extreme-range bombardment weapon system, fires huge ""shells"" that are little more than containment enclosures for energised plasma.

Galvanic weapons have sub-par projectile velocity, but make up for it by having projectiles that remain coherent and stable out to very impressive ranges.",Close Support,,,,
kyeltziv_shock_culverin,WEAPON,"Light cannon with a non-standard payload, primarily effective against shielding but also has a minor disruptive effect.

The miniature shock-cores loaded in the shells this weapon fires give it the ability to even further pressure targets as they can catalyse and arc to nearby components dealing minor damage.",Anti Shield,,,,
kyeltziv_shock_culverin_twin,WEAPON,"Twin light cannons loaded with a non-standard payload, primarily effective against shielding but also has a minor disruptive effect.

The miniature shock-cores loaded in the shells this weapon fires give it the ability to even further pressure targets as they can catalyse and arc to nearby components dealing minor damage.

Effectively a pair of Shock Culverins mounted onto a heavier frame, while the recoil forces of opposing barrels impacts accuracy somewhat, it is more than made up for with the doubled rate of fire.",Anti Shield,,,,
kyeltziv_shock_palliser,WEAPON,"Heavy cannon with a non-standard payload, primarily effective against shielding and also featuring a disruptive effect.

The shells are packed with a cluster of light shock-cores, while a single larger core would have provided superior disruptive capability it would also have required a far greater flux draw to charge before firing.",Anti Shield,,,,
kyeltziv_buster,WEAPON,"Fires bursts of semi-stable fusion reactions, devastating against lighter vessels but sheer volume of fire allows it to wear down even heavy armour given time.",Anti Armor,,,,
kyeltziv_buster_twin,WEAPON,"Twinned mount of the Fusion Buster with a heavier mounting, sheer volume of fire makes it highly effective against armoured targets.",Anti Armor,,,,
kyeltziv_light_killCloud,WEAPON,"On firing, a Light Killcloud Projector saturates an approach vector with a flight of microprojectiles. Devastating against both fighters and missiles.",Point Defence,,,,
kyeltziv_heavy_killCloud,WEAPON,A Heavy Killcloud Projector deploys a cluster of proximity fused microwarheads giving it unprecedented area saturation capability.,Point Defence,,,,
kyeltziv_packet,WEAPON,"The specialised cyclic feed that this weapon features allows it to deliver its shots at a blistering rate of fire, but the linked autoloader is unable to maintain the same pace resulting in a notably reduced fire-rate in the long term.

The volatile plasma packets enclosed in this weapons shells are specially designed to shear off chunks of armour plating on a penetrating detonation, this additional energy is directed outwards from the impact point making it of no additional value against hull or shielding.",,,,,
kyeltziv_packetRib,WEAPON,"The heaviest volatile plasma packet weapon Kyeltziv engineers have successfully managed to produce. While fire rate is limited somewhat over safety concerns, the heavy shells can nonetheless prove highly effective at shredding armour.

The volatile plasma rounds this weapon fires push the boundaries of what is considered safe for storage and if they were any appreciable amount larger then there would be a risk of the sheer concentration of volatile plasma simply auto-igniting on experiencing even the most minor unexpected agitation.",,,,,
kyeltziv_shock_fougasse,WEAPON,"A short ranged disruption weapon that fires a spread of disruption tuned shock-cores, highly valued for its ability to rapidly disable exposed targets.

kyeltziv,FACTION,"Born from Kyeltziv Technologies, a megacorporation that primarily specialised in light drone craft and semi-exotic weapons systems, with the fall of the gate system Kyeltziv Technologies third branch was left stranded in the persean sector, and after some internal strife they rebranded as the Kyeltziv Technocracy and set about securing a foothold for themselves in the sector. Since the collapse the Kyeltziv Technocracy initially constructed outposts on numerous promising worlds with an eye to start colonisation, but all of these were either abandoned or destroyed in the first AI war and ever since they have been more inwardly-focused.

After the restructuring into the Kyeltziv Technocracy the charter they operate under has been completely rewritten and is classified to outsiders, what little of it has been leaked suggests that they have plans in motion that may breach several domain regulations, but whether this is true or not is hard to determine with the fragmentary information available.",,,,,
